# Planar Shock Wave Reflection
## Explanation
In this code I am replicating reflecting of a blanar shock wave between two surface growing closer from each other.
A few assumptions are made:
1- Planar shock wave
2- Steady state
3- Ideal gas
4- Constant specific heat for now, therefore the same cp/cv ratio is used (to be changed)
5- Adiabatic
6- Neglect body forces
7- Neglect P.e
